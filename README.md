# Drawing App

https://thedanitor.github.io/drawing_app/

This project is from the Day 22 code along video from Udemy's 50 projects in 50 days series focused on web development. I have added some comments to the CSS and JavaScript to make notes to myself why certain choices are being made and what particular lines of code do.

### Overall Impression

I had no idea there was a canvas element. It also turns out it was not that difficult to use with a little guidance. The key was realizing that you need to start with a circle and create a line that trails it to make a smooth line appear on the screen.

### Things Learned

* HTML has a canvas element that is used to draw on a page
* input type of color creates a sliding color picker
* in CSS can select all children of an element with the syntax element > * {}
* Canvas has ctx (context) which has properties and methods that can be used to draw shapes/lines
